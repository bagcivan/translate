The little sisters entered the room to play ball.

“We have to be careful not to wake the white cat,” the tall one said softly.

"Or not to ruin the roses" whispered the fat one;

"But throw it high, dear sister, or we'll never hit the ceiling."

"You dear children," thought the white cat,

“Why would you come here to play? Shady trees, birds singing on branches are only around the corner and sunlight covers the path. Who knows but outside, can your ball touch the sky? You're just going to bother me here and maybe you will ruin the roses and the best you can do is hit the ceiling! ”
